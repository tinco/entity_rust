/// The event system will have a trigger function that takes an
/// argument that decides if the event will be triggered this tick
/// or the next tick. The default should be next tick to prevent
/// inadvertent infinite loop bugs.
///
/// The event system can then schedule all events handlers that
/// do not mutate components to be run in parallel.
/// All handlers that do mutate the component list can be run
/// sequentially after that. Perhaps we can even schedule
/// those with non-overlapping mutable component lists to
/// run in parallel.
///
/// The event loop should trigger every n ms and execute any
/// events that are queued up. Every event has a function
/// that is called by the trigger! macro that puts the event
/// on the queue.
///
/// 2. We need to register handlers.
/// 4. We need a mechanism for actually receiving the triggers and
///    handling the special 'tick' behaviour.
///
/// Event handlers: 
/// 
///  We call them with our arguments, but they need references to
///  the components they want too. Mega awesome would be if at some
///  point we can dispatch handlers in parallel depending on whether
///  they mutate the components.
///
///  For this we need to know what components the handler uses and
///  whether they mutate them or not.
