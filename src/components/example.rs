/// The coolest way to implement this would be to have two lists references.
/// One mutable, one is immutable.
/// 
/// The event system will have a trigger function that takes an
/// argument that decides if the event will be triggered this tick
/// or the next tick. The default should be next tick to prevent
/// inadvertent infinite loop bugs.
///
/// The event system can then schedule all events handlers that
/// do not mutate components to be run in parallel.
/// All handlers that do mutate the component list can be run
/// sequentially after that. Perhaps we can even schedule
/// those with non-overlapping mutable component lists to
/// run in parallel.
///
/// So the next step at least is to make a mutable list iterator
/// that we can use and have all events be executed sequentially.
///
/// An easy way could be that the event loop is responsible for taking
/// the lock and all the functions here take a reference to the unlocked
/// component list given to them by the event system.
